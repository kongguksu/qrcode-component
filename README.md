## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned + Continued development

I used flexbox to center the qrcode-card vertically and horizontally. In the process of doing this, I learned that it's useful to set **html {width: 100%}** and **body {min-width: 100%}** when making sure that the body takes up the whole browser screen.
